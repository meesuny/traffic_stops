# Introduction

This repository will analyze police traffic stop data collected in various Virginia counties from July 2020 to August 2022.  While some analysis of this data is available on the government website at https://data.virginia.gov/stories/s/rden-cz3h, this project will undertake a more fulsome analysis and also cross reference the traffic stop data along with additional data to gain further insight into traffic stop behavior by Virginia police of various localities.
